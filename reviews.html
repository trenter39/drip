                <span class="boldText review">Socket</span>
                <p class="reviewDesc">Socket offers a vast selection of products, from everyday essentials like pens to household appliances such as vacuum cleaners. However, despite its extensive catalog, customers have reported issues with delivery, with many orders never arriving. Additionally, customer support has been described as unresponsive, making it difficult to resolve issues. Reliability remains a concern. <br><span class="boldText rating"><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i> Rating: 3/5</span></p>

                <span class="boldText review">Beartrot</span>
                <p class="reviewDesc">Beartrot is a dream come true for bear enthusiasts, featuring a wide assortment of plush bears that customers can’t resist hugging. Beyond its delightful product selection, Beartrot excels in customer service and delivery efficiency. Orders arrive on time, and customers consistently praise the shopping experience.

                <span class="boldText review">Comin</span>
                <p class="reviewDesc">Comin is an ideal choice for those seeking thoughtful gifts, particularly for occasions like Homecoming. While the store offers a decent selection, its product range is somewhat limited. Delivery times can vary, usually taking around 10–15 days. Overall, while Comin is a reliable option for certain purchases, shoppers should be aware of the relatively slow shipping process. <br><span class="boldText rating"><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i> Rating: 4/5</span></p>

                <span class="boldText review">Hello</span>
                <p class="reviewDesc">Creativity shines through in Hello’s branding, but the shopping experience itself has been mixed. Customers appreciate the store’s unique identity, but order fulfillment can be inconsistent. Some customers have experienced extended delays in receiving their items, with one notable case involving a month-long struggle with customer service that resulted in receiving two phones instead of one.<br><span class="boldText rating"><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i> Rating: 3/5</span></p>

                <span class="boldText review">Orange</span>
                <p class="reviewDesc">Orange is a fantastic grocery store that also stocks select tech accessories. Customers have praised its fast and reliable delivery, often receiving their orders as early as the next day. The store goes the extra mile by including surprise gifts in some orders, adding a personal touch to the shopping experience. If you're looking for quick and efficient service, Orange is a great choice. <br><span class="boldText rating"><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i> Rating: 5/5</span></p>

                <span class="boldText review">Yours</span>
                <p class="reviewDesc">Yours may not be a household name, but it has been gaining traction through frequent advertisements. Skeptical yet curious, customers have tested its services and were pleasantly surprised. One notable purchase included a dishwasher, which arrived in just a few days—exceeding expectations. While its reputation is still growing, the store has proven itself to be a reliable option for larger household purchases. <br><span class="boldText rating"><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i> Rating: 4/5</span></p>
