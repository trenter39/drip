# Drip market or DRIP

dated December 2022 and was improved in 2025. the idea was to create a site with a responsive layout - navigation panel at the top, content in the center and footer at the bottom.

site uses icons from fontawesome to live itself a little bit. also site contains media queries to output itself correctly on devices' screens with different width.

DRIP can be viewed in detail here: https://trenter39.github.io/drip/
